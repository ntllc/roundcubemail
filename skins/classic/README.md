ROUNDCUBE WEBMAIL CLASSIC SKIN
==============================

This skin package contains the current development of the Classic theme
for the Roundcube Webmail software. It can be used, modified and redistributed
according to the terms described in the LICENSE section.

For information about building or modifying Roundcube skins please visit
https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/wiki/Skins

The theme uses icons originally designed by Stephen Horlander and Kevin Gerich
for Mozilla.org. In case of redistribution giving credit to these artwork
creators is mandatory.

INSTALLATION
------------

The skin can be installed by putting the content in a subfolder of the
the Roundcube's `skins` folder or by using composer:
```
composer require "roundcube/classic:~1.6.0"
```
Note: make sure to use version of the skin that matches the Roundcube version.
If it is not available use the closest lower version number. For example,
if your Roundcube version is 1.6.5, use skin version 1.6.x (with max X that exists),
if 1.6.x does not exist use 1.5.x and so on. Using 1.7.x and up might not work.
